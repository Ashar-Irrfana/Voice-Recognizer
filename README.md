# Voice-Recognizer
Our main is to create a voice-recognized music video player for the users. It gives the user the freedom to control video songs according to his/her wish. Here the user can play, pause, increase and decrease the volume, mute and unmute, go to the next song(both mp3 and mp4), the previous song, and finally exit from the system, using python.
